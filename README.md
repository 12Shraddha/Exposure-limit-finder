# Exposure-limit-finder
Developed a code that can retrieve VACATED 1989 OSHA PELs (TWA, ST, or C) values for a given chemical, by scraping data and API from the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards and the PubChem database and created an interface using tkinter, which allows users to easily search for and retrieve exposure limits for a wide range of chemicals.
